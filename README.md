DistributedFacebook is a distributed file management system built on an enhanced version of the **Chord** framework. It features a distributed fair mutex mechanism using the **Suzuki-Kasami** algorithm, ensuring secure and reliable file access across multiple nodes. The system integrates fault tolerance, privacy control, and scalable node management to provide robust file sharing and collaboration in decentralized environments.

Key functionalities include:
- Distributed hash table-based file storage
- Fair mutual exclusion for concurrency management
- Privacy control via node-based subscription mechanisms
- Resilient fault detection with PING/PONG and failure recovery
